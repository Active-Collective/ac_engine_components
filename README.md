This library is a collection of BIM tools based on [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and other libraries. It includes pre-made features to easily build browser-based 3D BIM applications, such as postproduction, dimensions, floorplan navigation, DXF export and much more.

## üß© Integration with fragments
As you might know, we have 4 open source libraries:
- [web-ifc](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc): the IFC parser and geometry engine.
- [fragments](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment): the open source format and 3D engine.
- [components](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_components): a set of tools to build BIM software fast. 
- [ui components](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_ui-components): our agnostic UI system.

Components doesn't work with this new version of Fragments yet. In the next release, at the end of Q2, all components will be updated to work with this new version of Fragments. In the meantime, you have 3 options:

- Work with Fragments and build your own BIM components from scratch.
- Work with Components (which don't use this new version of Fragments).
- Check out our [Accelerator Program](https://thatopen.com/accelerator) to get previous access to the upcoming components.

Once the release at the end of Q2 is made, Components will work natively with this new version of Fragments.

## Packages

This library contains 2 packages:

`@thatopen/components` - The core functionality. Compatible both with browser and Node.js environments.

`@thatopen/components-front` - Features exclusive for browser environments.

## Quick start

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
2. From the repository root run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn workspace viewer dev --host
   ```
3. Open <http://localhost:5173> to launch the viewer example.


## Usage

You need to be familiar with [Three.js API](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) to be able to use this library effectively. In the following example, we will create a cube in a 3D scene that can be navigated with the mouse or touch events. You can see the full example [here](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_components/blob/main/packages/core/src/core/Worlds/example.ts) and the deployed app [here](https://thatopen.github.io/engine_components/examples/Worlds/index.html).

```js
/* eslint import/no-extraneous-dependencies: 0 */

import * as THREE from "three";
import * as OBC from "../..";

const container = document.getElementById("container")!;

const components = new OBC.Components();

const worlds = components.get(OBC.Worlds);

const world = worlds.create<
  OBC.SimpleScene,
  OBC.SimpleCamera,
  OBC.SimpleRenderer
>();

world.scene = new OBC.SimpleScene(components);
world.renderer = new OBC.SimpleRenderer(components, container);
world.camera = new OBC.SimpleCamera(components);

components.init();

const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: "#6528D7" });
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
world.scene.three.add(cube);

world.scene.setup();

world.camera.controls.setLookAt(3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0);
```

## üß™ Viewer test

Run the glTF viewer example to verify that local models load correctly.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v3).
2. Install dependencies from the repository root
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Build the core library so Vite can resolve its modules
   ```bash
   yarn build-core
   ```
4. Start the viewer example
   ```bash
   cd packages/viewer
   yarn dev --host
   ```
5. Open [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
6. If `unit1.glb` ‚Ä¶ `unit4.glb` are present in `packages/core/assets` they load automatically. Use the file input to load your own `.glb` or `.gltf` file.
7. Use the **arrow keys** to move the selected model one meter at a time on X/Y.
8. Press **R** to rotate the selected model by 90¬∞.
9. Hit **Delete** or **Backspace** to remove the selected model(s).
10. Use the toolbar at the top to orbit, pan, zoom extents or change camera views.
11. Press **Cmd/Ctrl+Z** to undo the last move or rotation.
12. Right-click a mesh (e.g. a door) to select that part and use the palette to
    change its material. The **reset** button restores the original look.
13. Run `yarn test` to execute the placeholder test script.

### Viewer features

* **Sidebar library** ‚Äì draggable unit thumbnails with filenames. Upload custom models via the *Choose file* button.
* **Navigation toolbar** ‚Äì orbit, pan and camera view buttons with a paintbrush palette for textures and colors.
* **Multi-floor scenes** ‚Äì switch floors using the pill buttons or keys `1`‚Äë`3`; inactive floors show ghost grids.
* **Move/rotate controls** ‚Äì Shift‚Äëclick to multi-select, drag the red handle or use WASD/QE and the arrow keys. Press `R` to rotate. Hit Delete/Backspace to remove models.
* **Nudge arrows** ‚Äì six arrows appear when selecting a model and nudge it by one grid unit.
* **Metadata sidebar** ‚Äì lists mesh counts, triangle counts and material names for each loaded model.
